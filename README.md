# Hello, and nice to meet you!
My name is Jianqi Yang, or you can call me Lucky Young, a name derived
from the phonetic translation and meaning of my Chinese name,
and amazingly, they are both such wonderful things!

What you're looking for is probably [here](https://github.com/thinkswhat/Publication).

Finally, to share one of my favourite mottos:
> Die Luft der Freiheit weht

Generally translated as “the wind of freedom blows”, perhaps a great illustration of the spirit of open source!
