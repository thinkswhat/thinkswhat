# Hello
Hello and welcome to my homepage! My name is Jianqi Yang,in Chinese, it's 杨建祺.

What you're looking for is probably [here](https://github.com/thinkswhat/Publication).

# Biography
I am going to get an undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering, but I actually have a broad background in Mathematics and Statistics, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and Environmental Science. Currently, my research interests are focussed on the application of data science and its related methods to atmospheric science, in particular machine learning and data assimilation techniques. I am also interested in other concepts derived from this, such as AI4Scinece and Data Learning.

I am currently seeking a PhD opportunity to formally enter the field of atmospheric science and to use my skills in data science and computer technology to further advance atmospheric science, particularly in numerical weather prediction, for the betterment of the community.

## Interests
- Atmospheric science
- AI4Science, especially in atmospheric sciences
- Data Science and Statistics, especially Data Learning

## Why atmospheric science?
In fact, I did not enter the field of atmospheric science at the very beginning of my university career. My knowledge and interest in the field really came about as a result of my academic life and childhood experiences throughout my undergraduate studies.
- Atmospheric science
- AI4Science, especially in atmospheric sciences

## Something about me
我的人生就是在另一个有着这样的夕阳的午后确定的。

Since that day, I've been looking for an acre of land, between salt water and the sea strands.
